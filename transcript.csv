University's introduction",242.66,2.82
36,"to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science",245.48,2.31
37,and the art of programming.,247.79,1.41
38,And this is Spot.,249.2,1.89
39,"And our thanks to our
friends at 3D Cowboys",251.09,2.28
40,for bringing him by class today.,253.37,1.71
41,"Perhaps a round of applause for
our special Professor [INAUDIBLE]..",255.08,3.444
42,[APPLAUSE],258.524,3.336
43,My name is David Malan.,261.86,0.96
44,"And I actually took this class,
CS50, myself, some years ago.",262.82,3.45
45,But I almost didn't.,266.27,1.23
46,"And I didn't because when I
got to campus, as a first-year,",267.5,3.09
47,"I really gravitated toward
things already familiar, things",270.59,2.76
48,"with which I was already comfortable,
specifically, government.",273.35,2.1
49,"And I came in here thinking I was going
to major or concentrate in government.",275.45,3.25
50,"And it was only once I got to
sophomore year, fall semester,",278.7,3.14
51,"that some friends of mine were
coming to this class called",281.84,2.46
52,"CS50 that was very much to
beware at the time, in that it",284.3,3.99
53,"was an unfamiliar field to so
many of us, myself included.",288.29,2.58
54,"But I got up the nerve to go over the
threshold, sit in on the first class,",290.87,3.45
55,"just shop it, so to speak.",294.32,1.96
56,And I was hooked.,296.28,1.29
57,"I found that homework was,
for the first time, fun.",297.57,2.9
58,"And this was after having enrolled
only because the professor let",300.47,3.313
59,"me enroll pass/fail or [INAUDIBLE]
because I didn't really",303.783,2.417
60,think I could even cut it.,306.2,1.083
61,"But fast forward to five
Mondays later in the semester,",307.283,2.737
62,"I actually switched to a
letter grade, deciding,",310.02,2.0
63,"wow, this is actually something for me.",312.02,2.22
64,"And I say this because
computer science, what",314.24,3.24
65,"I didn't realize about
it at the time, really",317.48,2.16
66,"is this very general purpose way of
thinking and way of solving problems.",319.64,4.04
67,"And even if this is the
only CS class you ever take,",323.68,2.81
68,"even if this is the only formal
training you have in programming",326.49,3.45
69,"as a practical skill, it's
just so darn applicable",329.94,2.61
70,"to so many other fields-- the
arts, humanities, social sciences,",332.55,3.12
71,"natural sciences, and beyond, and
certainly within the STEM fields,",335.67,3.99
72,themselves.,339.66,0.87
73,"That said, it's going to often
feel a little something like this.",340.53,3.28
74,"This is from our friends at MIT, down
the road, which is one of their hacks",343.81,3.5
75,"whereby they connected a fire
hydrant to a drinking fountain,",347.31,3.99
76,"with a little sign up there that says,
""GETTING AN EDUCATION FROM MIT IS LIKE",351.3,3.66
77,"DRINKING FROM A FIRE HOSE,""
which is to say that it's",354.96,2.52
78,"going to feel, quite
often, in this class,",357.48,1.83
79,"too, that there's just
a lot of information.",359.31,1.95
80,"And you can't possibly
absorb it all, but realize",361.26,2.7
81,"that's to be expected, especially
in an introductory class.",363.96,2.79
82,"The whole point is for so much of it to
feel new, but with practice, with time,",366.75,4.77
83,"with years, even, looking
back, will you get all the more",371.52,2.87
84,comfortable with the material.,374.39,1.25
85,"But you're not meant to feel
comfortable along the way.",375.64,2.7
86,"And so let me encourage
you, invite you, expect",378.34,2.0
87,"you to get comfortable feeling
uncomfortable along the way,",380.34,3.24
88,"whether you have or have not prior
computer science or programming",383.58,3.81
89,experience.,387.39,0.69
90,"Now, back in my day, the class'
syllabus was a little bit different.",388.08,4.05
91,"And, really, when I and all of
my classmates exited the class,",392.13,3.308
92,"we would say to friends
that we learned how",395.438,1.792
93,"to program in C, which is a language
that we, ourselves, will still",397.23,3.63
94,learn in this class.,400.86,1.0
95,But that was it for languages.,401.86,2.18
96,"But nowadays, as you'll
see, we'll explore not just",404.04,2.91
97,"this older language called
C, but a more modern language",406.95,2.61
98,"called Python that's very much in vogue
for data science, and web applications,",409.56,4.02
99,and much more.,413.58,0.88
100,"But we'll also introduce
you, along the way,",414.46,1.833
101,"to another language called S-Q-L or SQL,
which is specifically for databases.",416.293,4.727
102,"And SQL is a different type
of programming language",421.02,2.31
103,"that's just going to give you
different ways of solving problems,",423.33,2.73
104,"different building blocks with which
to express problems you want to solve.",426.06,3.42
105,"We'll introduce you, toward
the end of the semester,",429.48,2.19
106,"yet another language,
JavaScript, often used",431.67,2.37
107,"with markup languages called HTML
and CSS, with which maybe you",434.04,3.375
108,"have some experience if
you've made websites.",437.415,1.875
109,"But we'll do this because so many of
today's actual real-world software",439.29,4.35
110,is web-based.,443.64,0.99
111,"Or it's phone-based,
mobile-based, but even then,",444.63,2.82
112,"it's using these same
languages, like JavaScript.",447.45,2.55
113,"And so by the end of
CS50, in particular,",450.0,2.7
114,"you won't know how to program
in X, or Y, or Z, per se.",452.7,3.12
115,"But, period, you'll
learn how to program.",455.82,3.33
116,"And, indeed, among the
goals of this class",459.15,2.04
117,"is to equip you with enough of a set
of concepts, enough practical skills",461.19,4.35
118,"and experience that after CS50, again,
if you never take another CS class,",465.54,3.9
119,you can teach yourself new languages.,469.44,2.25
120,And you won't feel--,471.69,0.96
121,"you won't have been reliant
on a class to, indeed,",472.65,2.79
122,"introduce you to each
and one of those ideas.",475.44,2.068
123,"And what are we going to
do, then, in this class?",477.508,2.042
124,"And, really, what are we
going to start doing today?",479.55,1.71
125,"Well, we're going to learn
how to solve problems.",481.26,2.142
126,"And that's really what
computer science is all about.",483.402,2.208
127,"We'll, very specifically,
today, knock off a few to-dos.",485.61,3.48
128,"We'll learn how to represent
simple things, like numbers.",489.09,3.04
129,"We'll learn how to represent letters
of an alphabet, like English.",492.13,2.75
130,"We'll learn how to represent
colors-- red, green, blue,",494.88,2.25
131,and everything in between.,497.13,1.11
132,"We'll learn how to represent,
more interestingly,",498.24,2.37
133,"full-fledged images that you might
see on the web or your phone.",500.61,2.82
134,"We'll talk about representing
videos and even audio files.",503.43,3.3
135,"So, by the end of today,
alone, you will exit here",506.73,2.81
136,"with a newfound mental
model for how you can",509.54,2.31
137,"represent all of today's media and
multimedia that we take for granted",511.85,4.29
138,and use most every day.,516.14,1.62
139,"But we'll also focus
today, ultimately, on how",517.76,2.61
140,"to write algorithms, like
step-by-step instructions for solving",520.37,3.15
141,"some problem, specifically,
implementing algorithms with code.",523.52,3.855
142,And that's what we'll find.,527.375,1.125
143,"An algorithm is just
something you can express",528.5,1.917
144,"in English or any human language,
but code is a translation of that",530.417,3.933
145,"to, presumably, the 0's and
1's that you've probably heard",534.35,2.91
146,is all that computers ultimately speak.,537.26,2.58
147,"And if you're feeling like
that's a lot for today,",539.84,2.19
148,"if you're feeling like that's
a lot for the whole semester,",542.03,2.458
149,"realize and take comfort in
knowing that -thirds of you",544.488,2.702
150,have never taken a CS course before.,547.19,2.53
151,"So even if you think, like
I did all those years ago,",549.72,2.42
152,"that, surely, my friends, the
kids I didn't even in the class,",552.14,2.907
153,"must know more than I,
have been programming",555.047,1.833
154,since they were six years old.,556.88,1.62
155,That's just not the case.,558.5,1.38
156,You're in very much good company.,559.88,1.38
157,"And within the class will
you find different tracks,",561.26,2.743
158,"by way of the homework
assignments, called ""problem sets,""",564.003,2.417
159,by way of the sections or recitations.,566.42,1.583
160,"There will be different
tracks for those of you",568.003,1.959
161,"less comfortable, more
comfortable, somewhere in between.",569.962,2.648
162,"And if you really don't
know why you are here today,",572.61,2.33
163,"we'll even have sections for those
least comfortable, where you just",574.94,3.03
164,"don't necessarily feel ready to dive
into CS or maybe STEM, more generally.",577.97,3.72
165,"But we'll get you there by way of
the course's support structure.",581.69,3.15
166,"And it's very much
grounded in this mindset.",584.84,2.94
167,"What ultimately matters in
this class is not so much",587.78,2.37
168,"where you end up relative
to your classmates,",590.15,1.875
169,"but where you end up relative
to yourself, when you began.",592.025,3.015
170,"So whether you have or have not
prior programming or CSS experience,",595.04,3.283
171,"it's not going to matter when
it comes to evaluation, when",598.323,2.417
172,"it comes to the output, be it a grade,
or a satisfactory mark, or the like.",600.74,3.58
173,"It's going to depend on,
really, where you are today,",604.32,2.54
174,"in this, what we call week zero, versus
the very end of the semester, when",606.86,5.1
175,"you will have built something grand,
of your very own, in software.",611.96,3.09
176,"But CS50 is also
characterized, fairly uniquely,",615.05,2.22
177,"by its community, its culture.",617.27,1.877
178,"And along the way, you'll
see that your experience",619.147,2.083
179,"is punctuated by a lot of social
and academic events alike.",621.23,3.45
180,"CS50 lunches, most every Friday,
we'll gather at a nearby restaurant",624.68,3.21
181,"called Changsho where we'll
have Chinese lunch together.",627.89,2.39
182,"And as many of you as
might want to attend",630.28,1.75
183,"that week will be able to join us,
sit down, and chat casually with me,",632.03,2.958
184,"the course's teaching staff, friends
of ours, alumni from industry, as well.",634.988,4.692
185,"CS50 Puzzle Day, coming up this
weekend, will be an opportunity,",639.68,2.95
186,"even if you have no prior CS
experience, just to solve problems,",642.63,4.11
187,"not jigsaw puzzles, but
puzzles in the logical sense.",646.74,3.05
188,We'll hand you a packet of puzzles--,649.79,2.7
189,"logic problems, or
riddles, or the like--",652.49,1.74
190,"that you, as teams, can solve together.",654.23,1.857
191,"And at the very end,
we'll walk you through.",656.087,1.833
192,"And along the way, there'll be not only
these puzzles, but pizza, and prizes,",657.92,3.43
193,"and so much more, as well.",661.35,1.61
194,"Towards the end of the semester,
we'll have a CS50 Hackathon whereby",662.96,3.39
195,"we'll get together around 7:00 PM,
at the start of reading period,",666.35,3.48
196,"and we'll finish up around
7:00 AM the next morning.",669.83,2.91
197,"And it will be this
opportunity to really bond",672.74,2.34
198,"with your classmates, your project
partners, if you work in a team,",675.08,3.06
199,"on your very own final
project, which is meant",678.14,2.37
200,"to be a capstone of the course,
something you build, yourselves,",680.51,3.24
201,"that we don't hand you
a specification for.",683.75,2.01
202,"But it's your final offboarding,
so that when you exit CS50,",685.76,3.33
203,you don't need CS50 anymore.,689.09,2.25
204,You don't need me.,691.34,0.76
205,You don't need your TF.,692.1,0.958
206,"You can actually write code
and solve problems on your own.",693.058,2.852
207,"So this picture here is one of our past
photos from earlier in the evening.",695.91,3.83
208,"Things get a little quieter
as we then, around 5:00 AM,",699.74,2.85
209,"drive anyone who's still awake
and energetic to a nearby IHOP",702.59,3.75
210,"for pancakes, around then.",706.34,1.8
211,"But here is how most of the evenings
tend to end for at least some",708.14,3.57
212,of your classmates prior.,711.71,1.29
213,"But at the very end of the class
is the so-called CS50 Fair,",713.0,2.67
214,"an exhibition of all of your final
projects for friends, faculty,",715.67,4.0
215,"students, and staff
across campus, whereby",719.67,1.94
216,you'll be invited to a space like this.,721.61,1.83
217,Bring your laptop.,723.44,0.78
218,"Bring your phone, whatever it
is you have built and created.",724.22,2.7
219,"And we'll just show it off
for a bit of the afternoon,",726.92,2.34
220,"complete with music, and
friends from industry,",729.26,2.61
221,"and candy, and all what makes
gathering together at term's end fond.",731.87,4.13
222,"And you'll wear,
ultimately, very proudly,",736.0,1.75
223,"we hope, your very own ""I took CS50,""
stating, very matter of factly,",737.75,4.02
224,"what I did some years ago; that, indeed,
this was a course I, myself, took.",741.77,4.02
225,"So, today, let's focus, then, on
computer science, like what is it.",745.79,3.33
226,"Well, it's really the
study of information.",749.12,2.67
227,"But, really, it's, more
specifically, about solving problems,",751.79,3.12
228,"using certain ideas and techniques, all
of which you'll exit the course with.",754.91,3.45
229,"So, as such, problem
solving is a goal that we'll",758.36,5.018
230,"approach by way of something
called ""computational thinking.""",763.378,2.542
231,"So computational thinking, you can
oversimplistically think about it",765.92,3.84
232,as thinking like a computer.,769.76,1.74
233,"But it's really the application of
ideas that we'll dive into today",771.5,3.91
234,"and we'll finish some
weeks from now, that you",775.41,1.97
235,"can apply to problems from this field or
most any other, but in a computational,",777.38,4.5
236,"that is, a very methodical,
very careful way.",781.88,2.89
237,"And that's what CS really did for
me and does for a lot of people.",784.77,2.75
238,"It helps clean up your
thought processes.",787.52,2.22
239,"Even if you go off into the real
world and do nothing in tech,",789.74,2.82
240,"you have an ability,
after classes like this,",792.56,2.28
241,"to express yourself a
little more correctly, more",794.84,3.18
242,"precisely and, generally,
having better command",798.02,2.64
243,of your own ideas and your language.,800.66,2.32
244,So what's problem solving?,802.98,1.43
245,Let me propose that this is it.,804.41,1.38
246,"This is as simple as we can make
today's goals and the semester's goals.",805.79,3.48
247,Problems to be solved look like this.,809.27,1.69
248,"You've got some input,
the problem to be solved.",810.96,2.0
249,"You've got a goal being the output,
like the solution there, too.",812.96,2.79
250,"And then somewhere in the
middle is the secret sauce,",815.75,2.25
251,"where we'll spend the next
several weeks figuring out how",818.0,2.375
252,we can convert these inputs to outputs.,820.375,1.975
253,"But before we can do
that, we all just have",822.35,2.52

there, or it's not.",1004.55,2.37

something like the base-10 system, 10",1218.77,4.33

100 times 1 plus 10 times",1268.23,2.96

that out, 100 plus 20 plus 3,",1271.19,5.22

553,Yeah?,1575.28,0.5
554,AUDIENCE: It's eight bits.,1575.78,0.97
555,DAVID J. MALAN: So it's just eight bits.,1576.75,1.667
556,It's just a more useful unit of measure.,1578.417,1.783
557,"And it happens to be a
power of 2, 2 to the third,",1580.2,2.515
558,which just makes math work out cleanly.,1582.715,1.625
559,"But it's just a convention, to have
more interesting units of measure",1584.34,3.27
560,than individual bits.,1587.61,0.93
561,So a byte is eight bits.,1588.54,1.81
562,"So, for instance, this represents,
using eight bits, eight light bulbs,",1590.35,4.34
563,the number you and I know is 0.,1594.69,1.77

565,"now you've got to do some quick math--
represents what number, instead?",1600.96,5.08
566,"So it's all 1's; eight of them, total.",1606.04,2.617
567,"How about over here, on the end?",1608.657,1.333
568,AUDIENCE: 255.,1609.99,1.06
569,"DAVID J. MALAN: So it's, indeed, 255.",1611.05,1.942
570,"Now, that's not the
kind of math that you",1612.992,1.708
571,"need to do in your head for a
class like this, but you could.",1614.7,2.61
572,"This is the ones place, twos,
fours, eight, 16, 32, 64, 128.",1617.31,7.38
573,"And because they're all 1, you just have
to add up all of those columns' values.",1624.69,4.11
574,And you get 255.,1628.8,1.77
575,"But a little mental trick, too,
is that, if you've got eight bits",1630.57,3.12
576,"and each of them can be two
possible values, 0 or 1,",1633.69,3.58
577,"that's like 2 possibilities here times
2 times 2 times 2 times 2, eight times.",1637.27,4.47
578,"So that's 2 to the eighth, so that
is maybe a little easier to do.",1641.74,3.57
579,That's 256.,1645.31,1.41
580,"Or easier, in the sense that you get
used to seeing these numbers in CS.",1646.72,3.06
581,That's 256.,1649.78,1.44
582,But wait a minute.,1651.22,0.81
583,How do I reconcile this with your 255?,1652.03,3.27
584,Because you start at 0.,1655.3,1.35
585,"So you lose one on the high end because
we started counting and representing",1656.65,4.47
586,"the number, like 0.",1661.12,1.71
587,All right.,1662.83,0.93

unary, or the like?",1671.6,5.81

592,"All right, so seeing none,
let's let things escalate a bit.",1678.01,3.127
593,"So how do you represent letters
because, obviously, this",1681.137,2.333
594,"makes our devices more
useful, whether it's",1683.47,1.792
595,in English or any other human language.,1685.262,1.758
596,"How could we go about representing
the letter A, for instance?",1687.02,3.72
597,"If, at the end of the
day, all our computers,",1690.74,2.63
598,"all our phones have access to is
electricity; or, equivalently,",1693.37,4.02
599,"switches; or, metaphorically,
tiny little light bulbs",1697.39,3.18

be on and off-- that's it.",1700.57,3.18
601,"There's no more building
blocks to give you.",1703.75,3.24
602,"How could we represent
something like the letter A?",1706.99,3.54
603,"Yeah, how about here?",1710.53,1.47
604,Yeah?,1712.0,0.812
605,AUDIENCE: You could assign a number.,1712.812,1.5
606,DAVID J. MALAN: Perfect.,1714.312,1.031
607,"So we could just assign
every letter a number.",1715.343,1.917
608,And we could do this super simply.,1717.26,1.417
609,"Maybe 0 is A, and 1
is B. Or maybe 1 is A,",1718.677,3.983
610,"and 2 is B. It doesn't really matter,
so long as we all agree and we all",1722.66,3.45
611,"use the same types of computers,
in some sense, ultimately.",1726.11,2.55
612,"Well, for various reasons, the
humans that designed this system,",1728.66,3.07
613,they went with the number 65.,1731.73,1.43
614,"So, nowadays, anytime your computer
is showing you the capital letter",1733.16,4.38
615,"A on the screen, underneath
the hood, so to speak,",1737.54,3.15
616,"it's actually storing a pattern of 0's
and 1's that represents the number 65.",1740.69,6.09
617,"And it tends to use seven bits
or, typically, eight bits, total,",1746.78,3.15
618,"even if it doesn't need
all of those bits in total.",1749.93,2.86
619,So how do we get there?,1752.79,2.19
620,"Well, here, for instance,
is that same pattern.",1754.98,2.51
621,"Here is that pattern of
bits that represents 65.",1757.49,2.49
622,And why?,1759.98,0.54
623,"Well, quick check here.",1760.52,1.68
624,"This is the ones place, twos,
fours, eights, 16, 32, 64's place.",1762.2,6.96
625,"OK, so 64 plus 1 gives me 65.",1769.16,3.48
626,"So that is to say here's how a computer,
using some light switches, so to speak,",1772.64,4.19
627,would represent the number 65.,1776.83,1.79
628,"And our Macs, our PCs, our
phones just all know this.",1778.62,2.92
629,"So whenever they see that in
their memory, so to speak,",1781.54,2.87
630,"they show a capital
letter A on the screen.",1784.41,3.15
631,So that's it.,1787.56,0.96
632,"That's the system known as
ASCII, the American Standard",1788.52,2.73
633,Code for Information Interchange.,1791.25,1.59
634,"And the A is actually operative there
because we're only talking, thus far,",1792.84,4.5
635,about English letters in our alphabet.,1797.34,2.16
636,"And, in fact, I claimed, a
moment ago, that we only use",1799.5,3.03
637,"seven, maybe eight bits to
represent letters of an alphabet.",1802.53,3.72
638,"So, just to come back to
you, if I may, how many",1806.25,2.16
639,"possible letters of the
alphabet could-- how",1808.41,2.49
640,"many possible letters of any alphabet
could we represent with eight bits?",1810.9,3.45
641,AUDIENCE: 256.,1814.35,0.96
642,"DAVID J. MALAN: 256, the
numbers 0 through 255.",1815.31,3.09
643,"Now, that's more than enough
for English because we've",1818.4,2.25
644,"got A through Z, uppercase,
lowercase, a bunch of numbers,",1820.65,2.848
645,a bunch of punctuation symbols.,1823.498,1.292
646,"But in a lot of languages, with accented
characters, a lot of Asian characters,",1824.79,3.87
647,"this is not nearly enough
memory or bits with which",1828.66,3.57
648,"to represent all of
those possible values.",1832.23,2.487
649,"So we need to do a
little better than ASCII,",1834.717,1.833
650,"but we can build on top of
what they did years ago.",1836.55,2.65
651,So here is a chart of ASCII codes.,1839.2,1.88
652,"It's just a bunch of columns showing
us the mapping between letters",1841.08,3.19
653,and numbers.,1844.27,0.5
654,"So, for instance, up here is the
capital letter A, 65; capital B, 66;",1844.77,4.65
655,"capital C, 67; dot, dot, dot.",1849.42,2.64
656,72 is H. 73 is I and so forth.,1852.06,4.273
657,"There's some weird things over
here, like special symbols,",1856.333,2.417
658,that we'll learn about over time.,1858.75,1.375
659,"But there's a mapping
between every English letter",1860.125,2.105
660,"of the alphabet and some
number, just as you'd propose,",1862.23,2.58
661,both for uppercase and lowercase.,1864.81,1.9
662,"So, for instance, if we highlight
just a few of these for now",1866.71,3.87
663,"and I say that I've just received
a text message or an email that,",1870.58,4.418
664,"underneath the hood, so to
speak, if I have the ability",1874.998,2.292
665,"to look at what switches are on and
off, I received this message here.",1877.29,5.64
666,"Well, first-- and this is not what
CS is about, but just fun fact.",1882.93,3.09
667,"Does anyone know what number
this would represent in decimal,",1886.02,3.45

like ones place, twos place?",1889.47,5.095
669,AUDIENCE: 72?,1894.565,0.855
670,DAVID J. MALAN: 72 is correct.,1895.42,1.66
671,"And again, not, intellectually,
all that interesting",1897.08,2.52
672,"and this is not the kind of math
that we spend all day as CS--",1899.6,2.18
673,a computer scientist doing.,1901.78,1.125
674,"But it's just following the
same darn pattern, which",1902.905,2.475
675,"is to say it might look
cryptic, but, conceptually,",1905.38,2.4
676,"intellectually, it ultimately
is exactly as we did before.",1907.78,2.762
677,"So, yes, I'll spoil
the rest of the math.",1910.542,1.708
678,"It's 72, 73, 33.",1912.25,2.61
679,"Now, anyone remember, in your mind's
eye, what message we just spelled?",1914.86,3.51
680,AUDIENCE: Hi.,1918.37,0.81
681,AUDIENCE: Hi.,1919.18,0.63
682,"DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
so it is, in fact, ""Hi!""",1919.81,1.71
683,"Though, no one really
said that excitedly.",1921.52,1.75
684,"What's the 33, if you noticed?",1923.27,1.31
685,AUDIENCE: Exclamation point.,1924.58,1.02
686,"DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so
a lot of people noticed.",1925.6,1.17
687,"Yes, it's an exclamation point.",1926.77,1.86
688,"And that's, indeed,
noticeable right here.",1928.63,2.67
689,33 is the exclamation point.,1931.3,1.763
690,"And that's just something,
eventually, that might sink in.",1933.063,2.417
691,"But, for the most part, if
you remember capital A is 65,",1935.48,2.87
692,"you can figure out at least 25 other
answers to these kinds of questions",1938.35,3.75
693,"because they're all
contiguous like that.",1942.1,1.96
694,So there's the exclamation point.,1944.06,1.68
695,"But at the end of the day, we might
just have this mapping known as ASCII.",1945.74,4.61
696,"And it's how our phones, and
computers, and devices, more",1950.35,2.65
697,"generally, actually store information.",1953.0,2.31
698,So we thought we'd make--,1955.31,1.74
699,"maybe take a little
pressure off of me here.",1957.05,1.92
700,And could we maybe flip things around?,1958.97,2.58

this newfound knowledge--",1961.55,2.61

866,"or with certain keystrokes on

this menu that, probably, you've",2275.78,3.45

873,"each of these faces, each of these

874,"And it turns out that one of
the reasons that we have just",2299.88,2.66
875,"so many [LAUGHS] such characters
nowadays is because we now",2302.54,6.7
876,use Unicode instead of ASCII.,2309.24,2.13
877,"So Unicode is a superset,
so to speak, of ASCII,",2311.37,3.0

realized, some time ago, that just",2314.37,3.66
879,"using eight bits to represent
letters of the alphabet",2318.03,2.34
880,"certainly isn't very good
when we want to represent",2320.37,2.7
881,"other, non-English languages.",2323.07,1.89
882,So Unicode doesn't just use eight bits.,2324.96,2.28
883,"It sometimes uses 16 bits per character,
sometimes 24 bits per character,",2327.24,5.28
884,"and sometimes even 32
bits per character.",2332.52,3.09
885,"Now, why those numbers?",2335.61,1.08
886,"That's just one byte, two bytes,
three bytes, or four bytes.",2336.69,3.99
887,And that gives us--,2340.68,1.452
888,does anyone know?,2342.132,0.708
889,"That gives us the ability
to represent as many as 4",2342.84,3.54
890,billion possible characters.,2346.38,2.25
891,"Because if the longest one is
32 bits, that's 2 to the 32,",2348.63,3.52
892,"which, if you do out the math,
trust me, is roughly 4 billion.",2352.15,2.94
893,So that's a lot of characters.,2355.09,1.34
894,"And we've got a lot of
room, then, for these emoji.",2356.43,2.61
895,"But it's not just about having
fun, pictorially, on the screen.",2359.04,3.09
896,"Unicode's mission really is to represent
and to preserve all human languages",2362.13,5.7
897,"digitally, both past,
present, and future.",2367.83,3.7

the entirety of human knowledge,",2371.53,3.89

those characters can be drawn,",2438.66,2.76

will interpret differently",2443.07,3.06

who's-- the first name, of course,",3165.49,3.52

could just turn, page by page,",3169.01,3.71

keep turning and turning.",3174.59,2.41

care about correctly.",3196.293,1.807

1226,"he might get sandwiched
between two pages.",3226.263,2.227
1227,"But do I have to throw the
algorithm out altogether?",3228.49,3.72
1228,Probably not.,3232.21,1.05
1229,"Once I reach the K section,
which is past the J section,",3233.26,2.813
1230,"I could double back at least one
page, at least, [PATS TELEPHONE BOOK]",3236.073,2.917
1231,"and just make sure I didn't
blow past him completely.",3238.99,2.55

because I'm going two pages",3241.54,2.91
1233,"at a time, plus one extra step.",3244.45,1.472
1234,So it's still an improvement.,3245.922,1.208

worst case, if it's",3247.13,1.792
1236,"not John, but someone
whose name starts with Z,",3248.922,1.978

just 500 steps because I'm",3252.86,3.35

one, in case I have to double back,",3256.21,3.45

where is John Harvard?",3280.36,3.3

left, alphabetically.",3283.66,2.47

much bigger bite out of the problem.",3286.13,3.53

and conquer this problem",3289.66,2.82

me with a smaller problem,",3296.08,5.16

now I'm in the E section.",3304.37,2.78

now he's to the right.",3312.46,1.23

again, throw that 250 pages away.",3315.815,4.565

1,000 to 500 to 250 pages.",3320.38,3.15
1264,"Now I'm moving because the first
algorithm was one page at a time,",3323.53,2.94

to the middle; roughly,",3329.373,2.167
1268,"to the middle; roughly, to
the middle, hopefully, I'll",3331.54,2.25
1269,find John Harvard on one final page.,3333.79,2.56
1270,"Can only do this once,
but one final page.",3336.35,2.79
1271,"So that invites the
question, I would think,",3339.14,2.87
1272,"if the phone book does
have 1,000 or so pages,",3342.01,2.67
1273,"how many times can I divide the problem
in half to get down to one last page?",3344.68,5.53
1274,"So it's, roughly, 10.",3350.21,1.37
1275,"And the quick math is 1,000 goes to
500 to 250 to 125 to 67 something.",3351.58,4.623
1276,"So we have to deal with
rounding issues, eventually.",3356.203,2.167
1277,"But assuming we work out the math,
it's, roughly, 10 page tears.",3358.37,3.27

pages and still faster than 500 pages.",3361.64,5.94
1279,So it's fundamentally better.,3367.58,1.77
1280,"And, indeed, if I finally get to that
final page, in the software world,",3369.35,4.442
1281,"you'd see something like this,
John Harvard and his number,",3373.792,2.458
1282,which you're welcome to call or text.,3376.25,1.56
1283,"But that's how we now have our answer,
much like the single page there.",3377.81,5.04

efficient that actually is.",3382.85,4.24
1285,"So here's a very rough, broad--
with broad strokes, a chart.",3387.09,3.47
1286,So here's an xy plot.,3390.56,1.438

going to be the size of the problem.",3391.998,2.792
1288,"And, by that, I mean, how many
pages are we trying to go through?",3394.79,3.57

take to solve the problem?",3401.48,2.13

John Harvard or anyone else?",3403.61,2.49

1294,This means a lot of time.,3407.54,1.42
1295,"So what's the relationship
among these algorithms?",3408.96,2.15
1296,"Well, the first one is
actually just a straight line.",3411.11,2.38
1297,"If there's n pages in
the phone book, well, I",3413.49,3.84
1298,"claim that it's a
one-to-one relationship.",3417.33,2.73
1299,"Because if Verizon or the phone
company adds another page next year,",3420.06,4.23
1300,"that just means I might have
one more step next year,",3424.29,2.61
1301,"as well, to find John
Harvard or anyone else.",3426.9,3.09
1302,"But the second algorithm,
it's also a straight line,",3429.99,2.94
1303,"but it's lower, even though
it might not look obvious.",3432.93,2.365
1304,And what do I mean by that?,3435.295,1.125
1305,"Well, let me just draw
some temporary lines.",3436.42,1.833
1306,"If this is how many pages
are in the phone book-- dot,",3438.253,2.357
1307,"dot, dot-- notice that it takes
this much time, on the red line,",3440.61,3.48
1308,to solve the problem.,3444.09,1.27
1309,"But if I, instead, use
the second algorithm,",3445.36,3.17
1310,it takes me half as much time.,3448.53,1.977
1311,"So, even though they're
both straight lines,",3450.507,1.833
1312,"one is strictly lower than the
other, which means it's faster.",3452.34,2.583
1313,It's better.,3454.923,0.717
1314,"But the third algorithm is a
fundamentally different shape,",3455.64,2.67
1315,"and it looks a little
something like this.",3458.31,1.78
1316,"And it looks like it's going to
flatten, flatten, flatten out,",3460.09,2.28
1317,but it never does.,3462.37,0.89
1318,It just rises ever so slowly.,3463.26,2.91

maybe Cambridge and Allston, here",3466.17,3.12

so we go from 1,000 page phone book",3469.29,3.74

means, if we're here this year,",3473.03,5.07
1322,we're over here next year.,3478.1,1.56
1323,It's not all that much higher.,3479.66,1.53

were using the first two algorithms.",3481.19,3.13
1325,Why?,3484.32,0.5
1326,"It'd be an extra 1,000 steps to
find someone in that combined phone",3484.82,3.06
1327,book or maybe another 500 steps.,3487.88,2.01
1328,"But, to be clear, if we're using
my third and final algorithm,",3489.89,3.63
1329,"how many more steps will
it take me next year,",3493.52,2.1
1330,"when Cambridge and Allston merge
into one 2,000-page phone book?",3495.62,5.31
1331,"Just one more step, no big deal.",3500.93,1.87
1332,It's one more page tear.,3502.8,1.6

ultimately, about not just writing",3504.4,2.5

that are correct, but, now,",3506.9,2.82
1335,"that are well-designed or
efficient, specifically.",3509.72,3.35

a better programmer, perhaps,",3513.07,2.5

problem-solver than someone else,",3515.57,2.667
1338,"is acquiring, over time, these skills.",3518.237,1.893

the problem quickly and dirtily,",3520.13,3.15

going to have a lot of data",3523.28,2.28

design algorithms that look like this.",3531.2,3.34

is called a logarithm.",3534.54,1.83

fundamentally faster and different",3539.495,3.625

capture the accuracy of the algorithm?",3564.17,3.292
1357,"Short answer, no.",3567.462,1.178
1358,"For instance, if I drew
a straight line that",3568.64,2.82

would imply that the algorithm takes",3571.46,4.11
1360,"the same amount of time, no
matter how many pages there are,",3575.57,2.67

just pull a random page from the phone",3578.24,3.24

going to be accurate,",3583.23,2.0

speaks to efficiency",3587.01,2.81

not the correctness of it.",3589.82,3.06

to use another mechanism altogether,",3592.88,4.29

efficiency, in this way?",3598.28,3.84

translate this to some actual code.",3603.44,4.65

today, one actual programming language,",3608.09,3.54

consider something called pseudocode.",3611.63,3.09

step by step, precisely.",3628.57,2.94

1381,"Here might be some
representative pseudocode",3632.65,2.73

and final algorithm in a way",3635.38,3.957

you could do the same at home.",3639.337,2.583

of artificial intelligence, nowadays,",3972.4,4.29

this as an opportunity",3976.69,2.1
1506,to connect some of these dots.,3978.79,1.47
1507,"Because, indeed, over the
course of the semester,",3980.26,2.2
1508,"we'll be-- not only be talking
about artificial intelligence or AI,",3982.46,3.53
1509,"but really using it all
the more constructively",3985.99,2.91

1514,"that you'll experience within
CS50, itself, this year.",4002.37,2.83
1515,"So let's talk about the
so-called chatbots that",4005.2,3.02
1516,"inspired some of those
headlines with which we began",4008.22,2.28
1517,"class, that weren't quite on the nose.",4010.5,2.28
1518,"So the class will still
be taught by us humans,",4012.78,2.1

duck, a chatbot of sorts.",4014.88,4.29
1520,Now what do I mean by this?,4019.17,1.42
1521,"Well, it turns out that, when it
comes to implementing something",4020.59,3.5
1522,"like an artificial
intelligence, we don't quite",4024.09,2.64
1523,"have all of the building blocks yet,
certainly after just today's week zero,",4026.73,3.82
1524,to implement something like that.,4030.55,1.45
1525,"But I think we can skate in
that direction, intellectually.",4032.0,2.96
1526,"So, for instance, if we were to take a
stab at implementing our own chatbot--",4034.96,4.71
1527,"some interactive text-based
program that talks to us,",4039.67,3.213
1528,"and answers questions,
and the like-- we could",4042.883,1.917
1529,"try borrowing some of today's ideas
already, those functions, conditionals,",4044.8,4.05
1530,"loops, and more.",4048.85,1.157
1531,And I could write something like this.,4050.007,1.583
1532,"If I am writing code or
pseudocode for a chatbot,",4051.59,2.78
1533,"I could program the chatbot
to do something like this.",4054.37,2.8
1534,"If the student says,
hello, to the chatbot,",4057.17,2.06
1535,"then the chatbot should
say, hello, back.",4059.23,2.61
1536,"Else, if the student says,
goodbye, well, the chatbot",4061.84,3.06
1537,"should say, goodbye, back.",4064.9,1.68
1538,"Else, if the student asks how you are,
the chat bot should say that it's well.",4066.58,5.22
1539,"But things get a little
harder when you start",4071.8,2.22
1540,"asking more interesting
questions, like, else,",4074.02,3.45
1541,"if the student asks why 111
in binary is 7 in decimal.",4077.47,3.52
1542,"Now, you could imagine that
we just have a conditional,",4080.99,2.99
1543,"with this Boolean expression, that
programs the chatbot to just give you",4083.98,4.59
1544,"the answer and explain, in an English
sentence, why that, in fact, is.",4088.57,3.66
1545,"But what if you, the student, asks why
110 is 6 in decimal or why 010 is 2?",4092.23,8.52
1546,"I mean, you can just imagine the
explosion in the amount of code",4100.75,3.479
1547,"that we would have to write to just
anticipate every darn question that you",4104.229,4.141
1548,"might ask about today and every
other class, not to mention all",4108.37,3.005
1549,of the knowledge in the universe.,4111.375,1.375
1550,"So, surely, there are other
ways to implement algorithms",4112.75,3.899
1551,"that allow something
like a chatbot or AI,",4116.649,2.67
1552,"more generally, to be fed input,
still, like all of the internet, all",4119.319,4.381
1553,"of the worldwide web, all of the
pages and textual content therein,",4123.7,3.06
1554,"but to let it just figure out
how to answer our questions based",4126.76,4.29
1555,"on those kinds of inputs, assuming
the inputs, themselves, are accurate.",4131.05,3.28
1556,"So ""large language models""
is a term you might",4134.33,2.18
1557,"have heard bandied about over
the past several months, or LLMs.",4136.51,3.21
1558,"And a large language model really
is an implementation, in software,",4139.72,5.009
1559,"of code that actually takes, as
input, lots and lots of language--",4144.729,4.901
1560,"like the text of lots and lots of web
pages, dictionaries, encyclopedias,",4149.63,3.68
1561,"Wikipedias, and the like--",4153.31,1.469

English words or any human language,",4154.779,4.95
1563,"what a typical human might
actually say when asked a question.",4159.729,3.178
1564,"And some of these
questions are easy, right?",4162.907,1.833
1565,"Probably, on the internet, alone, not
to mention everyday life, if someone",4164.74,3.425
1566,"extends their hand and says, ""Hi.",4168.165,1.375

software that just",4174.7,2.55

probabilistically, statistically, based",4177.25,4.319

the most sophisticated",4185.442,1.917

you and I, the humans,",4187.359,1.792
1577,"we don't try to anticipate
every possible input.",4189.151,2.828
1578,"Rather, we give it a
more general purpose",4191.979,2.641
1579,"input, like all human knowledge, and
ideally just let it figure things out.",4194.62,3.657

hallucinations or just mistakes",4199.61,2.39
1582,that these large language models make.,4202.0,1.68
1583,But their inputs are imperfect.,4203.68,1.325
1584,"And sometimes there's a
bit of randomness sprinkled",4205.005,2.125

to always say the exact same thing.",4207.13,2.958
1586,"Even you and I might say, ""Eh, I'm
not that great today"" 10% of the time.",4210.088,4.162

the output in some way.",4214.25,2.48
1588,"But within CS50 and within this
world of large language models,",4216.73,3.9
1589,"we do have these tools like
ChatGPT, and Bing, chat, and others.",4220.63,4.0
1590,"And we'll stipulate that,
for CS50's purposes,",4224.63,2.18
1591,"the direction we're going
this year is that this",4226.81,2.1
1592,"is what's in the

not to simply take away",4237.348,1.792

in my view, and clearly helpful",4239.14,4.11

guardrails, intellectually, on just how",4244.72,3.72
1599,helpful these chatbots are.,4248.44,1.213
1600,"Because as you've probably
seen, if you ask it a question,",4249.653,2.417
1601,"these chatbots are already
pretty good at not just helping",4252.07,2.49
1602,"you finish your current
thought, but it'll",4254.56,1.75
1603,"hand you your second and your third
thought and do the assignment for you.",4256.31,3.59
1604,"But I think, through
prompting, so to speak,",4259.9,2.76
1605,"we'll be able to coax
some of our own tools,",4262.66,2.19
1606,"being computer scientists,
ourself, in a direction",4264.85,2.25
1607,"that you actually find to be the
right balance, akin to having",4267.1,3.1
1608,"a good tutor by your side 24/7,
who doesn't just hand you answers,",4270.2,4.11
1609,"but, indeed, tries to
lead you to the same.",4274.31,1.913
1610,"So you actually get something
out of the experience,",4276.223,2.167

months from now,",4278.39,2.13

still stand on your own.",4282.38,2.5

CS50's own AI-based software which",4284.88,3.89
1615,"will actually take the form of a CS50
duck, which is actually available now--",4288.77,4.44
1616,"and we'll use it throughout the term--
at CS50.ai, a web-based application",4293.21,3.96

to ChatGPT, but that",4297.17,2.28

the keyboard, but ideas",4531.5,3.6
1705,"because what really
matters in this program",4535.1,2.07
1706,"is that ""printf"" is a function
here for our purposes.",4537.17,3.73
1707,"And that function is to display
information on the screen.",4540.9,3.08
1708,"Everything else, as
we'll soon see, has value",4543.98,2.88
1709,"and will be understood by you, before
long, but for now, it's a distraction.",4546.86,3.575
1710,Let's focus on those building blocks.,4550.435,1.765
1711,"When it comes time to write
code, though, for the curious,",4552.2,2.74
1712,"especially if you've
programmed before, we'll",4554.94,1.875
1713,"use a very popular free
and open-source tool",4556.815,2.075
1714,"called Visual Studio Code, or VS Code.",4558.89,2.37
1715,"We'll use a cloud-based version of
it that we pre-install everything",4561.26,4.74
1716,"you need in the cloud
for you so you don't",4566.0,2.07
1717,"have to deal with headaches like
getting your Mac or PC to work.",4568.07,2.91
1718,"You'll use instead this
URL, cs50.dev, but more",4570.98,2.94
1719,"on that in next week, week one.",4573.92,1.95
1720,"For now, we'll use another
cloud-based editor called Scratch.",4575.87,3.78
1721,"And odds are some number
of you use this probably",4579.65,2.31
1722,"as early as like middle
school or the like.",4581.96,2.01
1723,"And that was fine to create
your own animations, games,",4583.97,3.33
1724,"interactive art, or the like.",4587.3,1.35
1725,But we'll use it today for just a bit.,4588.65,1.95
1726,"And we'll use it in the
course's first homework,",4590.6,2.07
1727,"AKA problem set 0, to explore
now some of these same ideas.",4592.67,4.2
1728,"And among the goals today
for the remainder of today",4596.87,2.85
1729,"is not to focus so much on
Scratch and the particulars",4599.72,3.2
1730,"because this is not a
language that you're",4602.92,1.75
1731,"going to use often but to give you
very visual representations of ideas",4604.67,5.61
1732,"so that when things do escalate
next week to C, to the more cryptic,",4610.28,3.51
1733,"it's the same ideas just typed out
instead of dragged and dropped.",4613.79,4.05
1734,"So by that, I mean this.",4617.84,1.62
1735,"I'm going to go ahead and share in just
a moment the user interface of Scratch.",4619.46,3.81
1736,"But what's nice about
Scratch is that this",4623.27,2.1
1737,"is how we're going to implement
that same program today.",4625.37,3.03
1738,"These are two blocks or
puzzle pieces on the screen,",4628.4,2.8
1739,"and they've been interconnected to
tell the computer to say ""hello, world""",4631.2,4.47
1740,on the screen.,4635.67,0.9
1741,"The user interface
that we're about to use",4636.57,1.92
1742,will look generally something like this.,4638.49,2.162
1743,"It's a web-based editor
that you can also",4640.652,1.708
1744,download it locally to use offline.,4642.36,1.8
1745,"And you'll see that at the left here
are a whole bunch of puzzle pieces",4644.16,3.96
1746,or blocks.,4648.12,0.9
1747,"They're categorized by
color, and the blue ones",4649.02,2.61
1748,"tend to relate to motion, for instance.",4651.63,2.35
1749,The purple ones represent looks.,4653.98,1.97
1750,The pink one represents sounds.,4655.95,1.8
1751,The yellow one represents events.,4657.75,2.43
1752,More on that soon.,4660.18,1.05
1753,"The orange ones represent
control, and then",4661.23,2.04
1754,"there's operators, variables, my
blocks, and even some extensions",4663.27,3.12
1755,we can install as well.,4666.39,1.3
1756,"So it just categorizes things
visually and colorfully so that you",4667.69,4.13
1757,can find what you're looking for.,4671.82,1.65
1758,"But we're going to use these
puzzle pieces to drag and drop them",4673.47,3.27
1759,onto this area here.,4676.74,1.56
1760,"And we're going to connect them
when we want them to do something.",4678.3,3.73
1761,What can they do?,4682.03,0.86
1762,"Well, by default, Scratch comes
with this cat here, otherwise known",4682.89,3.12
1763,"as a sprite, which is a character
in a game or in a graphics context.",4686.01,3.75
1764,"And this cat lives in this
two-dimensional world in which",4689.76,2.55
1765,"the cat can go up, down, left, right.",4692.31,1.74
1766,"And you can actually
change the cat's costume",4694.05,2.28
1767,"to be a dog, a bird, or anything else.",4696.33,2.4
1768,"It really is more of an idea than it
is a specific animal in this case.",4698.73,4.53
1769,"But the world that Scratch lives in
looks a little something like this.",4703.26,3.69
1770,"It's like a Cartesian plane with
x-coordinates and y-coordinates.",4706.95,2.91
1771,"And the numbers don't so
much matter fundamentally,",4709.86,2.19
1772,"except that when you want the
cat or any character to go up,",4712.05,3.34
1773,"down, left, or right
by some amount, it's",4715.39,1.91
1774,"useful to know, for instance, that 0, 0
is the middle, 0 comma 0 for x comma y.",4717.3,5.685
1775,All the way up is a y value of 180.,4722.985,2.565
1776,All the way down is -180.,4725.55,1.92
1777,All the way to the left is -240.,4727.47,2.7
1778,All the way to the right is 240.,4730.17,1.86
1779,"And generally, you're not going
to have to worry about numbers.",4732.03,2.625
1780,"You're going to use these relatively--
go right, go left, go up, or down.",4734.655,3.375
1781,"But that's just the world that
Scratch itself lives in here.",4738.03,3.94
1782,So let's go about using Scratch here.,4741.97,1.76
1783,"I'm going to change over
to my cloud-based editor",4743.73,3.15
1784,"here, where I've gone
to scratch.mit.edu.",4746.88,3.24
1785,"And I've clicked Create in
order to create a project.",4750.12,2.4
1786,"And that gives me this
blank canvas here.",4752.52,2.302
1787,"And I'm going to do these somewhat
quickly because I kind of know",4754.822,2.708
1788,what I'm looking for.,4757.53,0.91
1789,"But part of the process with problem
set zero is going to be clicking,",4758.44,2.96
1790,"and dragging, and sort
of scrolling around",4761.4,2.01
1791,to see what building blocks exist.,4763.41,1.98
1792,"But I know under Events
there's this puzzle piece here",4765.39,3.63
1793,when green flag clicked.,4769.02,1.89
1794,Why is that germane?,4770.91,1.2
1795,"Well, if I zoom out, and go back to
Scratch's world at the right here,",4772.11,3.61
1796,"notice that above
Scratch's world there's",4775.72,2.0
1797,"a green flag, which is going to
mean go, and a red stop sign, which,",4777.72,3.15
1798,"of course, is going to mean stop.",4780.87,1.42
1799,"So if I drag this puzzle piece
anywhere into the middle,",4782.29,4.49
1800,it's just going to plop where I put it.,4786.78,2.4
1801,"But what that means semantically is
when someone clicks that green flag,",4789.18,4.2
1802,"I want Scratch the cat
to do this other thing.",4793.38,3.06
1803,"Well, what do I want it to do?",4796.44,1.53
1804,"Well, let me go under Looks.",4797.97,1.59
1805,"And looks here in purple have
some puzzle pieces like this.",4799.56,4.53
1806,"Well, I can say hello for
some number of seconds,",4804.09,2.4
1807,or I can just go ahead and say hello.,4806.49,2.13
1808,So let's do that.,4808.62,0.81
1809,I'm going to drag this say block.,4809.43,2.22
1810,"And notice that as soon
as I get close enough,",4811.65,1.98
1811,"it's going to magnetically
want to connect.",4813.63,1.932
1812,"So I can let go, and they
snap together automatically",4815.562,2.208
1813,because they're the right shape.,4817.77,1.333
1814,"I don't have to say
hello, exclamation point.",4819.103,1.997
1815,"I can change it to the more
canonical, hello comma world.",4821.1,2.82
1816,"So anything in this
white oval is editable",4823.92,2.52
1817,that you can change as just text there.,4826.44,2.43
1818,"If I now zoom out, let me go
ahead and click the green flag.",4828.87,3.09
1819,"And voila-- this should be
my first program in Scratch.",4831.96,4.596
1820,"Hello, world.",4836.556,0.874
1821,"Without any of the
distractions of syntax",4837.43,1.98
1822,"or weird characters on the screen,
it's just done what I want it to do.",4839.41,3.01
1823,All right.,4842.42,0.5
1824,Let me go ahead and click Stop there.,4842.92,1.542
1825,"And let me make it a
little more connected",4844.462,2.778
1826,to what we've discussed thus far.,4847.24,1.51
1827,"So this puzzle piece
here, say hello, world,",4848.75,2.63
1828,"represents what type of building
block using the vocabulary of today?",4851.38,4.99
1829,So it's a function.,4856.37,1.05
1830,"So these purple blocks are
functions, say, hello, world.",4857.42,2.628
1831,"And let me give you another
piece of terminology.",4860.048,2.042
1832,"These white ovals that
take textual input--",4862.09,2.82
1833,"in general, those are called
parameters or arguments.",4864.91,3.3
1834,"And they customize the
behavior of a function.",4868.21,3.4
1835,"So a parameter or an
argument customizes,",4871.61,2.57
1836,"modifies the default behavior of a
function, like in this case, say.",4874.18,3.63
1837,"Similarly, in the C code from
earlier that we'll see next week,",4877.81,3.18
1838,"the printf function took a quoted phrase
like, hello, world, similarly as input.",4880.99,6.36
1839,But more on that in the future.,4887.35,2.62
1840,"So how does this connect to the
mental model we presented earlier?",4889.97,2.84
1841,"Well, here's problem-solving as I
described it earlier, inputs to outputs",4892.81,4.33
1842,with algorithms or code in the middle.,4897.14,1.95
1843,"Well, what we've got here really is an
input of, hello, world, the white oval.",4899.09,4.62
1844,"The function or algorithm that it's
going into as input is the say block.",4903.71,4.89
1845,"And what is the output of using
this say block, the say function?",4908.6,3.36
1846,"It's the visual effect of having the
cat have the little speech bubble appear",4911.96,3.69
1847,"above its head, saying, hello, world.",4915.65,2.41
1848,"So everything we do, in
fact, can be mapped back",4918.06,2.84
1849,"to that very simple idea
of inputs and outputs.",4920.9,3.69
1850,"Well, let's make it a little
more interesting, though.",4924.59,2.25
1851,"It's a little boring to just
say ""hello, world"" all the time.",4926.84,2.59
1852,Let me go ahead and drag this away.,4929.43,2.07
1853,"And if you just drag it to the left and
let go, it gets automatically deleted.",4931.5,3.68
1854,"Let me go under Sensing
in light blue here.",4935.18,3.4
1855,"And you'll see there's a
bunch of blocks, one of which",4938.58,2.27
1856,"is an ask block, an ask function,
which is going to prompt",4940.85,3.33
1857,"the human, me, for some input.",4944.18,1.99
1858,"So let me go ahead and drag that
over here, and it snaps together.",4946.17,3.53
1859,"I could change the question,
but I'm OK with that question.",4949.7,2.49
1860,We'll use what's your name.,4952.19,1.48
1861,"But notice that this block,
ask, is a little special.",4953.67,3.23
1862,"It is not just going to display
like a speech bubble on the screen.",4956.9,3.34
1863,"It's actually going to
return a value, and this is",4960.24,2.27
1864,another term of art today and onward.,4962.51,1.74
1865,"A return value is some value that can
be handed back to you conceptually",4964.25,4.242
1866,"from a function so that you
can do something with it.",4968.492,2.208
1867,"It's as though the ask function
asks someone for their name,",4970.7,4.325
1868,"writes it down on a piece of paper,
and hands you the piece of paper.",4975.025,2.875
1869,"You can do anything now that
you want with that name.",4977.9,2.25
1870,"And here is how you access the
name in this special block called",4980.15,3.66
1871,"answer, which, again, will
start calling a return value.",4983.81,3.52
1872,"So if I want to say ""hello"" to someone
specific, I'm going to do this.",4987.33,3.44
1873,Let me zoom out.,4990.77,1.03
1874,"Let me go back to Looks,
and let me go back to Say.",4991.8,3.71
1875,"And I'm going to change the say
block here to ""hello, comma.""",4995.51,4.38
1876,Then I'm going to zoom out.,4999.89,1.38
1877,"Well, I need two inputs, I think.",5001.27,2.43
1878,"So I'm going to grab another say
block, and I'm going to put it below.",5003.7,2.94
1879,"And I could just type
""David,"" but this is",5006.64,2.52
1880,"going to defeat the whole point
of asking me for the name.",5009.16,2.5
1881,And it will only work for me.,5011.66,0.95
1882,So I don't want to do that.,5012.61,1.18
1883,"So let me go back to Sensing, and
notice the shape is important here.",5013.79,4.73
1884,"Even if it's not quite the
same size, the shape matters.",5018.52,2.61
1885,"And I can actually drag this and
change the input of this say function",5021.13,4.56
1886,"to be whatever that return
value is, that piece of paper",5025.69,3.18
1887,that has the person's name on it.,5028.87,1.56
1888,"And it grows to fill,
but now we have a program",5030.43,3.12
1889,"that I think when I click the green
flag-- watch-- is going to prompt me.",5033.55,3.69
1890,What's your name?,5037.24,1.127
1891,And now I have room to type down here.,5038.367,1.583
1892,"So I'm going to type D-A-V-I-D.
I'm going to hit Enter,",5039.95,2.42
1893,"and it should say ""hello, Dave.""",5042.37,1.63
1894,Wait.,5044.0,0.5
1895,Hmm.,5044.5,1.61
1896,Huh.,5046.11,0.94
1897,Maybe it was-- didn't work.,5047.05,2.94
1898,D-A-V-I-D. Here we go.,5049.99,1.17
1899,"Hello, David.",5051.16,1.005
1900,Hmm.,5052.165,1.365
1901,"It's missing the hello, but I'm quite
sure we have a hello right there.",5053.53,5.68
1902,So what explains this bug or mistake?,5059.21,2.96
1903,Yeah.,5062.17,0.947
1904,AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,5063.117,3.479
1905,So they overlap.,5066.596,2.494
1906,DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.,5069.09,1.71
1907,"Put another way, my Mac,
my PC, it's just so darn",5070.8,2.91
1908,"fast that it did exactly
what it was supposed to.",5073.71,2.61
1909,"But it said ""hello, David"" so fast that
we didn't even see, we being the human,",5076.32,4.26
1910,"the slowest part of the
puzzle, see the actual hello.",5080.58,2.215
1911,"So there's a few different
ways to fix this, as you know.",5082.795,2.375
1912,"We could have it say ""hello""
for some number of seconds.",5085.17,3.49
1913,So I could kind of do that.,5088.66,1.25
1914,So let me do this.,5089.91,0.75
1915,"I can decouple these by just
dragging and letting it go",5090.66,2.55
1916,so that they're magnetically far apart.,5093.21,2.01
1917,"Let me go ahead and drag this
one, say hello for two seconds.",5095.22,3.39
1918,"I'm going to change the grammar
here to be hello comma again.",5098.61,3.42
1919,"I'm going to go ahead
and disconnect these two.",5102.03,3.09
1920,"I'm going to throw away the old
one that I don't want to use.",5105.12,3.04
1921,"And I'm going to reconnect
this so that now--",5108.16,3.3
1922,OK.,5111.46,0.5
1923,"It's going to say hello for two
seconds and then my name, hopefully.",5111.96,3.0
1924,So let me click Stop and Start.,5114.96,2.22
1925,D-A-V-I-D. Enter.,5117.18,3.79
1926,OK.,5120.97,0.57
1927,"So it's better, but it's
kind of poorly implemented.",5121.54,4.037
1928,"Like, come on.",5125.577,0.583
1929,I just wanted to say hello comma David.,5126.16,1.625
1930,Why is that hard?,5127.785,1.0
1931,"Well, maybe we can actually
combine these a little differently.",5128.785,2.625
1932,And let me propose this.,5131.41,1.2
1933,"Let me actually get rid
of these blocks again.",5132.61,3.15
1934,"And let me go ahead
and just say one thing.",5135.76,2.67
1935,"But can I somehow combine this to say
hello comma David all in one breath?",5138.43,5.22
1936,"Well, it turns out if
I go under Operators,",5143.65,2.698
1937,"I know from having played with this
before that there's this puzzle",5146.348,2.792
1938,piece down here called join.,5149.14,1.89
1939,It's an oval.,5151.03,1.433
1940,"It's a little big, but,
again, it will grow to fill.",5152.463,2.167
1941,"And by default, it wants to join
two words, ""apple"" and ""banana.""",5154.63,2.708
1942,But those are just placeholders.,5157.338,2.492
1943,"So let me go ahead and drag
this over the default hello.",5159.83,4.16
1944,"Let me change ""apple"" to hello
comma space and then banana.",5163.99,4.71
1945,Let me go back to Sensing.,5168.7,1.53
1946,"Let me grab answer and
drag and drop that.",5170.23,3.4
1947,"So now notice that I'm
kind of layering my ideas.",5173.63,3.11
1948,"And put another way, the
output of this join block",5176.74,4.24
1949,"is presumably going to
join two things together,",5180.98,2.0
1950,apple and banana or hello comma David.,5182.98,2.13
1951,"And then the output of join is
going to become the input to say.",5185.11,4.35
1952,"So aesthetically, it just looks better.",5189.46,2.44
1953,"It's still correct,
but it's just better.",5191.9,1.89
1954,"So if I type ""David,"" and
hit Enter, hello, David.",5193.79,3.05
1955,"This is what a normal
program would presumably",5196.84,1.98
1956,"do, not show you part of the phrase
and then the rest of the phrase.",5198.82,3.57
1957,"Like, it's just better in this way.",5202.39,1.84
1958,"So let's connect this now to this same
puzzle piece and this methodology.",5204.23,4.25
1959,"So here's that same puzzle piece, ask.",5208.48,2.13
1960,"How do we fit it into this input
and output flow with algorithms?",5210.61,2.91
1961,"Well, the input to that puzzle piece
is something like, what's your name,",5213.52,3.6
1962,question mark.,5217.12,1.08
1963,"Then the algorithm or the
code implementation thereof",5218.2,3.48
1964,"is this ask block and wait so the human
has a moment to type their response in.",5221.68,4.56
1965,"The output of that function
recall is a return value.",5226.24,3.308
1966,"You don't see anything on the screen by
default because we've not used say yet,",5229.548,3.292
1967,but we get this return value.,5232.84,2.02
1968,"And let me scooch everything
over now so that we can now",5234.86,3.26
1969,join those inputs together.,5238.12,1.99
1970,So here's this puzzle piece.,5240.11,1.5
1971,"Let me go ahead and propose that
the inputs now to the join block",5241.61,3.33
1972,"are two arguments or two parameters,
so to speak, hello and answer.",5244.94,5.16
1973,"They go into that join puzzle
piece, whose purpose in life",5250.1,2.64
1974,is to return one joined version thereof.,5252.74,3.3
1975,"Let me slide this all
over logically now so",5256.04,2.43
1976,"that now that output becomes
the input to the say block",5258.47,4.38
1977,"and now is why the cat has the
speech bubble saying all at once,",5262.85,3.48
1978,hello comma David.,5266.33,1.41
1979,"So what we've done here is
kind of composed the output",5267.74,3.88
1980,"and from one function
into the input of another.",5271.62,2.397
1981,"And you can think of this in
a couple of different ways,",5274.017,2.333
1982,"left to right, as I
did there, or kind of",5276.35,1.8
1983,"like stacking these things
on top of one another.",5278.15,2.59
1984,"But at the end of the
day, even as programming",5280.74,2.12
1985,"gets more and more powerful for us,
it's just inputs and outputs, inputs",5282.86,4.65
1986,and outputs.,5287.51,0.81
1987,"And thankfully, with built-in
functionality from our friends",5288.32,2.91
1988,"at MIT who designed Scratch, I can
even do something playful like this.",5291.23,3.45
1989,"I can go to that Extensions
button at the bottom.",5294.68,2.31
1990,"And there's a lot of fancy things I
can add here, like text-to-speech.",5296.99,3.27
1991,"So let me go ahead and
choose text-to-speech.",5300.26,2.42

change the say block in purple.",5302.68,5.37

block, and let me borrow this.",5308.05,2.4

be a little more interesting.",5316.47,2.5

play all day long with that.",5347.82,2.25

to meow automatically two, or three,",5388.91,3.45

sort of expand to give room for me.",5415.22,3.52

three times, it meowed three times.",5428.83,3.36

like two seconds in between?",5459.4,2.95

here, and here, and here, and here.",5467.913,2.917

just write minimal code",5489.685,3.265

more functionality.",5492.95,2.29

this literally ""meow.""",5555.027,1.833

ahead and just click OK.",5556.86,2.29

create that sound, meow.",5642.94,1.833

abstracted those pieces",5644.773,2.607

for us by just giving us",5647.38,3.06
2150,these puzzle pieces we see here.,5650.44,1.84

designed now because now I've",5657.33,4.31

little more cat-like.",5776.64,2.41

first and then the rest of this code.",5782.0,3.0

myself another green flag block.",5785.0,3.5

create a cat that allows us to pet it",5788.5,3.93

it'll meow when I do that.",5794.53,2.29

let me grab this if conditional,",5796.82,5.45

the sprite [INAUDIBLE]..",5848.94,2.15

of the screen, notice",5855.2,2.43

2239,So I click the green flag.,5873.125,1.835

2241,"The mouse pointer was not
touching the cat at that moment",5877.23,2.935
2242,because it was touching the green flag.,5880.165,1.625
2243,"So, of course, it didn't meow.",5881.79,1.53
2244,So what maybe is the fix here?,5883.32,2.04
2245,What puzzle piece can we add?,5885.36,1.62

2263,"DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, maybe forever.",5916.703,1.417
2264,"So your approach would work, but
it's very much a hack, if you will.",5918.12,4.11
2265,"Like, I would have to time it perfectly
so that the mouse pointer is touching",5922.23,4.47
2266,"it, or, conversely, I have
to drag it there and just",5926.7,2.34
2267,leave it there for five seconds.,5929.04,1.5

you don't just touch a cat",5930.54,2.5
2269,"and then five seconds
later it meows at you.",5933.04,1.92
2270,"Like, presumably, we want
it to be more interactive.",5934.96,2.23
2271,So I like this idea of a loop.,5937.19,1.47
2272,Right?,5938.66,0.5
2273,"Why don't we just tell the cat
to forever listen for the cursor",5939.16,5.28

goes in, and Oscar gives me a point.",6273.43,4.02

2448,"I hate this song now, like 10 plus
hours listening to this song on loop",6323.3,3.63
2449,just to get the timing right.,6326.93,1.23
2450,"But it brings to life all
of these different sprites.",6328.16,2.88
2451,"And if you play it again and again,
it's always a little bit different",6331.04,3.09
2452,because I'm using some randomness.,6334.13,1.47
2453,"So this newspaper doesn't
always fall from there.",6335.6,2.91
2454,Sometimes it's here.,6338.51,1.14
2455,Sometimes it's here.,6339.65,1.03
2456,"And so here, again, we have
mechanics of a game where",6340.68,2.24
2457,"things are being perturbed a
little, randomized a little bit",6342.92,2.85
2458,to keep things more interesting.,6345.77,2.002
2459,And let me go ahead.,6347.772,0.833
2460,OSCAR: (SINGS) I love trash.,6348.605,1.635
2461,DAVID J. MALAN: There we go.,6350.24,1.167
2462,How. about raise a little volume?,6351.407,2.013
2463,One more piece of trash.,6353.42,1.47
2464,So a clock.,6354.89,0.6
2465,"It just goes on forever,
this kind of game.",6355.49,2.11
2466,But let's go ahead and consider.,6357.6,1.41
2467,Let me close that.,6359.01,1.05
2468,Let me go ahead and consider.,6360.06,1.55
2469,"How I went about implementing
that from the get-go.",6361.61,3.16
2470,So I will stipulate--,6364.77,2.15
2471,"let me open a few of these versions
here-- that the very first thing I did",6366.92,4.17
2472,"was pretty much just
implement the stage.",6371.09,1.98
2473,Right?,6373.07,0.15
2474,"I was kind of procrastinating,
so I poked around.",6373.22,2.042
2475,"I found the Sesame Street lamppost,
and I dragged it into the world.",6375.262,3.128
2476,And done.,6378.39,0.5
2477,Version one is done.,6378.89,0.93
2478,"It didn't do anything, but at least
I had the world sort of laid out.",6379.82,3.69
2479,"That is to say I took a
baby step toward my goal.",6383.51,2.31
2480,"Then I started thinking
about, all right,",6385.82,1.708
2481,"how do I bring the trash to life, even
if it doesn't do much of anything else?",6387.528,4.092
2482,"And so I created another sprite
by clicking the appropriate button",6391.62,2.75
2483,in that bottom right-hand corner.,6394.37,1.47
2484,"And I thought about, well, what
do I want this trash to do?",6395.84,2.58
2485,"I want it to just kind
of fall from the sky.",6398.42,2.44
2486,"And so what I did here
was the following.",6400.86,3.83
2487,"If I go to this trash piece
here or-- actually, sorry.",6404.69,3.33
2488,Out of order.,6408.02,0.76
2489,"What I actually did first was I
didn't even have the trash fall.",6408.78,3.08
2490,"If I play this game, the trash
just stays there in the air.",6411.86,3.42
2491,But I can do this.,6415.28,2.2
2492,"I can drag it, and as before,
as I touch the other sprite,",6417.48,3.89
2493,I get the trash can lid to go up.,6421.37,1.72
2494,So how do I do that?,6423.09,0.99
2495,"Well, let me click on Oscar
down there, my first sprite.",6424.08,3.05
2496,"And here are the puzzle pieces
via which I implemented this idea.",6427.13,3.45
2497,"I changed Oscar's
costume, his appearance,",6430.58,2.76
2498,"to be just number one, which was one of
the images I imported into the program.",6433.34,4.62
2499,And then I forever did this.,6437.96,1.86
2500,"If Oscar is touching
the mouse pointer, then",6439.82,2.64
2501,"change Oscar's costume to number
two, otherwise change it back to one.",6442.46,3.93
2502,So it's super simple animation.,6446.39,1.8
2503,"I'm just toggling between lid
up, lid down, lid up, lid down,",6448.19,3.78
2504,but it kind of feels interactive.,6451.97,1.74
2505,"And if I wanted to
really make this pretty,",6453.71,2.1
2506,"I could have 30 different costumes where
the lid is ever so slightly higher.",6455.81,4.77
2507,"Then it would look even more
like a movie or fluid motion.",6460.58,3.54
2508,"But this was enough to
get the job done, which",6464.12,2.52
2509,"is to say I didn't try to implement
all of ""Oscartime"" together.",6466.64,3.06
2510,"I just took a second
baby step toward my goal.",6469.7,2.79
2511,"And then my next version
of ""Oscartime"" might",6472.49,2.46
2512,"have looked a little something
like this, where now the trash--",6474.95,2.725
2513,there's more going on here.,6477.675,1.125
2514,"Let's look at two of
these blocks of code.",6478.8,3.5
2515,"The first thing I did was I
enabled drag mode to draggable,",6482.3,2.672
2516,"and I had to Google to figure
this out because otherwise it",6484.972,2.458
2517,"didn't let me drag the trash
while playing the game.",6487.43,2.46
2518,"But once I figured that
out, I tell the trash",6489.89,2.91
2519,"to go to a random
x-coordinate between 0 and 240",6492.8,3.9
2520,"from left to right and
then the y location 180",6496.7,2.97
2521,"because I always want the
trash falling from the sky.",6499.67,2.4
2522,And then what do I do?,6502.07,1.2
2523,"I told the trash to forever change its
y-coordinate, its vertical coordinate,",6503.27,4.26
2524,"by negative 1, negative
1, negative 1, one pixel",6507.53,3.21
2525,"at a time, which creates the
illusion of it falling from the sky.",6510.74,3.45
2526,"But I needed to do one other
thing, and let me scroll up.",6514.19,2.76
2527,"Each of your sprites can have
multiple programs, multiple scripts,",6516.95,4.41
2528,"so to speak, that are not
attached to one another.",6521.36,2.71
2529,They will happen in parallel for you.,6524.07,1.98
2530,The second one is saying this.,6526.05,1.7
2531,"Forever if the trash is touching
Oscar, what should it do?",6527.75,5.1
2532,"Go to a completely different x
and y location at the very top.",6532.85,4.59
2533,Why?,6537.44,0.51
2534,"Well, as soon as I drag
the trash over the Oscar,",6537.95,3.06
2535,"I want it to disappear as
though it's going into the can.",6541.01,2.52
2536,"And I then want it to reappear
at the top so more trash falls.",6543.53,3.3
2537,"So I just thought about
what would it mean",6546.83,2.01
2538,for the trash to go into the trash can.,6548.84,2.07
2539,"Well, who cares?",6550.91,0.96
2540,"What really matters to the
human user is that it just",6551.87,2.34
2541,disappears and teleports elsewhere.,6554.21,2.77
2542,"And so that's the idea
I implemented here.",6556.98,2.64
2543,"So if you can reduce intuitive ideas to
just basic building blocks like this,",6559.62,5.34
2544,"you can start to make things
much more interactive.",6564.96,2.48
2545,"And lastly, if I look
at this version here,",6567.44,2.53
2546,you'll see that we've combined these.,6569.97,3.08
2547,"And so indeed, if I actually
go ahead and play this now,",6573.05,2.88
2548,not only is it falling.,6575.93,1.86
2549,"I can let it fall right on top
of Oscar and watch it disappear.",6577.79,3.3
2550,"But notice Oscar doesn't pop out yet
because that was the fourth version",6581.09,3.705
2551,and then the fifth version.,6584.795,1.125
2552,"And then I added the annoying
music and so forth but sort of",6585.92,2.73
2553,"composed this program
step by step by step",6588.65,2.95
2554,so as to accomplish my larger goal.,6591.6,1.593
2555,"And this is going to be true
of all of the code you write,",6593.193,2.417
2556,"be it in Scratch, or C, or Python, or
in the like, trying to come up with--",6595.61,5.37
2557,"or rather, trying to reduce your ideas,
your grand vision to just baby steps,",6600.98,4.38
2558,"building blocks so that
you start with version one,",6605.36,2.31
2559,and maybe you submit version 10 or 20.,6607.67,2.34
2560,"But you don't try to implement
version 10 or 20 at the get-go.",6610.01,3.18
2561,You take those incremental steps.,6613.19,2.59
2562,All right.,6615.78,0.5
2563,How about one other?,6616.28,0.99
2564,"Well, let me propose this.",6617.27,2.28
2565,"Let me go ahead and open
three games that represent one",6619.55,3.82
2566,"that your predecessors also implemented,
which looks a little something",6623.37,4.2
2567,like this in version zero.,6627.57,1.65
2568,"Suppose I wanted to
implement a game that",6629.22,3.0
2569,simply has these kinds of mechanics.,6632.22,1.68
2570,"I'm touching my arrow keys on my
keyboard-- up, down, left, and right.",6633.9,3.15
2571,And I'm moving the Harvard logo.,6637.05,1.41
2572,Let me zoom in a bit.,6638.46,1.15
2573,"So if I hit the up arrow,
the Harvard shield goes up.",6639.61,2.6
2574,"If I hit the down arrow,
the shield goes down.",6642.21,2.55
2575,"If I go all the way to
the left, it goes left",6644.76,2.31
2576,"until it hits the wall and
same thing on the right.",6647.07,2.478
2577,"So this is like the beginnings
of a game or a beginning",6649.548,2.292
2578,"of a maze, something like that.",6651.84,1.53
2579,"Well, how might I implement this?",6653.37,1.78
2580,"Well, let me look inside this one.",6655.15,2.06
2581,"And there's a lot going on, but,
again, I sort of took simple steps.",6657.21,3.81
2582,Notice that I've got three sprites--,6661.02,1.71
2583,"a left wall, which is
just a straight line,",6662.73,2.19
2584,"the right wall, which
is a straight line.",6664.92,2.22
2585,"And just intuitively, why did
I implement those as sprites?",6667.14,3.57
2586,"Why do they need to exist
as entities themselves?",6670.71,4.53
2587,"Yeah, in front.",6675.24,0.99
2588,AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],6676.23,0.3
2589,DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.,6676.53,0.875
2590,I want it to interact with the shield.,6677.405,1.628
2591,"So I need to be able to ask
that Boolean expression, like,",6679.033,2.417
2592,"not touching mouse pointer but
touching shield, for instance,",6681.45,3.49
2593,a different type of yes/no question.,6684.94,1.62
2594,"And so what is the code for
the shield actually doing?",6686.56,2.57
2595,"Well, there's a lot of duplication, and
let me focus on the abstraction first.",6689.13,3.72
2596,"Notice that I've got this
one green flag clicked.",6692.85,2.83
2597,"I want the shield to go
dead center, 0 comma 0,",6695.68,2.75
2598,"and then forever listen for the human's
keyboard, and feel for the wall.",6698.43,4.17
2599,"So I decided to implement my
own pink puzzle pieces that",6702.6,3.215
2600,implement the two separate ideas.,6705.815,1.375
2601,"One, just listen for the
keyboard-- up, down, left,",6707.19,2.26
2602,right-- and then do something.,6709.45,1.25
2603,"And then feel for walls is
this idea of whenever I go up,",6710.7,3.07
2604,"down, left, or right,
if I touch a wall, I",6713.77,2.78
2605,"need to stop doing whatever the
keystrokes are telling me to do.",6716.55,4.05
2606,"So now if we dive into those
implementation details, listen and feel",6720.6,4.98
2607,"are abstractions, custom puzzle pieces.",6725.58,2.35
2608,"Let's look at the
implementation details.",6727.93,1.94
2609,"Well, here's the keyboard.",6729.87,1.35
2610,"If the key arrow up is
pressed, change y by 1.",6731.22,4.62
2611,"If key down arrow is pressed,
change y by negative 1.",6735.84,3.655
2612,"And you can probably
see where this is going.",6739.495,1.875
2613,Right arrow is x by 1.,6741.37,1.94
2614,"Left arrow is x by
negative 1, and that's",6743.31,2.61
2615,"sort of all that's involved
with up, down, left, right.",6745.92,3.13
2616,But wait a minute.,6749.05,0.98
2617,"Why is there no loop in this
listen for keyboard puzzle piece?",6750.03,5.88
2618,"I needed a loop last time
so it constantly works.",6755.91,3.33
2619,AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],6759.24,1.53
2620,DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.,6760.77,1.0
2621,"I put the loop in my
main part of my program",6761.77,2.58
2622,"up top so something is telling me
to keep listening again and again.",6764.35,3.67
2623,"So it's got to be somewhere,
but it doesn't have",6768.02,2.0
2624,to be in the actual implementation.,6770.02,1.74
2625,"And lastly, how about
this feel for walls?",6771.76,2.19
2626,"Well, if touching left wall, which is
just another sprite, change x by 1.",6773.95,4.47
2627,"So that is to say if I'm
touching the left wall,",6778.42,2.46
2628,"I want to bounce it
back the other direction",6780.88,2.585
2629,and same thing on the right wall.,6783.465,1.375
2630,"If I'm touching the right
wall, I want to bounce it",6784.84,1.74
2631,"back to the left, which effectively
means that even if the human's hitting",6786.58,3.09
2632,"the key, it's like
fighting with this code,",6789.67,2.01
2633,"but it's never going to go through
the wall based on that math.",6791.68,3.21
2634,It's going to stop it right there.,6794.89,1.87
2635,All right.,6796.76,0.5
2636,Let's add something else to the mix.,6797.26,1.5
2637,"Suppose I want the game to change
to be a little something like this,",6798.76,2.88
2638,"where Yale is some kind of block
in between me and the exit.",6801.64,3.66
2639,So some dramatic race here.,6805.3,1.84
2640,OK.,6807.14,0.5
2641,"I just got by, but the
Yale logo doesn't seem",6807.64,2.46
2642,"to be doing all that
much except bouncing.",6810.1,2.1
2643,"So I'm guessing there's a loop, maybe
a conditional checking for those walls",6812.2,3.46
2644,too.,6815.66,0.5
2645,"So let's go ahead and
zoom out, see inside.",6816.16,2.663
2646,"Let's not worry about Harvard
because it's pretty much the same.",6818.823,2.667
2647,Let's look at the Yale puzzle pieces.,6821.49,2.03
2648,"And sure enough, go to the middle.",6823.52,2.19
2649,0 comma zero.,6825.71,1.17
2650,"Point in direction 90, so
point horizontally on the grid.",6826.88,4.05
2651,"And then if touching left
wall or touching right wall--",6830.93,2.94
2652,"I'm kind of cheating this time, but
cleverly, just spin around and do 180",6833.87,4.6
2653,so you effectively bounce off the wall.,6838.47,1.728
2654,This just tightened up my code.,6840.198,1.292
2655,"I don't need to do the
negative 1 or the plus 1.",6841.49,2.0
2656,"I just say bounce in this
form of code, otherwise just",6843.49,3.52
2657,constantly move one step.,6847.01,1.41
2658,"Now, if this is a game where Yale
is supposed to be better and faster,",6848.42,3.66
2659,"well, let's change the 1 to 5.",6852.08,1.44
2660,Move 5 pixels at a time.,6853.52,1.78
2661,Let's move it 10 back and forth.,6855.3,2.31
2662,Let's maybe 100.,6857.61,1.43
2663,Uh-oh.,6859.04,1.11
2664,So what just happened?,6860.15,1.23
2665,"That is a bug, which we can
avoid by just not doing that.",6861.38,3.93
2666,But why did it break out of the wall?,6865.31,2.0
2667,Yeah.,6867.31,1.0
2668,AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,6868.31,1.29
2669,At first it was [INAUDIBLE].,6869.6,1.29
2670,DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.,6870.89,1.0
2671,"Because I'm doing 100
steps at a time, I'm",6871.89,2.12
2672,"never actually touching the
other sprite because I'm",6874.01,2.19
2673,sort of stepping way over it.,6876.2,1.86
2674,"So there's never a moment where
they're actually touching.",6878.06,2.55
2675,"So previously, I was just getting
lucky by doing fewer steps because it's",6880.61,4.02
2676,"gradually going over
the wall, which gives me",6884.63,2.07
2677,just enough time to detect as much.,6886.7,1.857
2678,"So I would have to kind
of tinker, and he'll",6888.557,1.833
2679,handle this a little bit differently.,6890.39,1.542
2680,So it's a bug if it's too fast.,6891.932,1.858
2681,"But at least if I keep
it slow and reasonable",6893.79,1.94
2682,"the math actually does work out, so
long as it starts again in the middle.",6895.73,4.14
2683,"Well, let's do one final flourish here,
whereby let's bring MIT into the mix.",6899.87,4.33
2684,Right?,6904.2,0.5
2685,"They're super smart, so
maybe they can kind of",6904.7,2.07
2686,track us and follow wherever I'm going.,6906.77,4.62
2687,So how might this work?,6911.39,1.75
2688,All right.,6913.14,0.5
2689,"So nothing happens yet because we
haven't finished composing the game.",6913.64,2.94
